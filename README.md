# Modifying This Repo
### Cloning repository
***Before you star you must have Python 3.8 installed in your system***  

### Setting Up Environment
After doing so, go to the `steds-care-backend` directory using command line or PyCharm Terminal and we will install the `env` environment for your setup by running:  
`python3 -m venv python-env`  
  
### Activating Environment
Now that you have the environment, in order to be in the environment you type:  
`source python-env/bin/activate`  

### Installing/Uninstalling Dependencies
Make sure you install dependencies. You do so by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you added more or removed dependencies and need to generate a new `requirements.txt`, you do so by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

#### .env file
This file you have to make on your own.

### Deactivating Environment
Now you should be in the `env` environment. To get out of the environment you type `deactivate` in command line.
